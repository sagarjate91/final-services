Data access control is a challenging issue in public
cloud storage systems. Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption 
(CP-ABE) has been adopted as a promising technique
to provide flexible, fine-grained and secure data access control
for cloud storage with honest-but-curious cloud servers. However,
in the existing CP-ABE schemes, the single attribute authority
must execute the time-consuming user legitimacy verification and
secret key distribution, and hence it results in a single-point
performance bottleneck when a CP-ABE scheme is adopted in
a large-scale cloud storage system. Users may be stuck in the
waiting queue for a long period to obtain their secret keys,
thereby resulting in low-efficiency of the system.
